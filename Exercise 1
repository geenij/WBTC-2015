# WBTC-2015

Goal for this exercise is to create IRI patterns to identify myself on the web. 

So here my first step into designing IRIs:

http://genevièveleonore.fr/education
http://genevièveleonore.fr/experience
http://genevièveleonore.fr/interests

Why did I chose those IRI patterns?

I'm half Swiss and half French, living in Switzerland and going regularly on vacation to France.
Beacause I have a French name, I've chosen the top-level-domain ".fr".
