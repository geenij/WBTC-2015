Goal for this exercise is to create IRI patterns to identify myself on the web. 

So here my first step into designing IRIs:

for general information about me:
http://genevièveleonore.fr/i
http://genevièveleonore.fr/i/#birthday

for all information about my education:
http://genevièveleonore.fr/education
http://genevièveleonore.fr/education/#esclaneuveville

for all information about my work experience:
http://genevièveleonore.fr/work
http://genevièveleonore.fr/work/#upu

for all information about sports I'm interested in:
http://genevièveleonore.fr/sports
http://genevièveleonore.fr/sports/#yoga

Why did I chose those IRI patterns?

I'm half Swiss and half French, living in Switzerland and going regularly on vacation to France.
Beacause I have a French name, I've chosen the top-level-domain ".fr".

ELI5 Linked Data

Firstly, data by itself has different types like images, videos or just text. 
Secondly the web is like a big container with all that data existing in it.
That data gets into the web when people put in the web for everyone to see it.

The problem is, that computers aren't that smart. They don't understand the relastionship between some data pieces.
For example they don't know what a picture shows or if a link is useful or not.

So linked data uses some formats to express relationships between data pieces.
For expample I (Geneviève) know my best friend (Nicole). 

If we connect all the data published on the web like this, we get a global information repository.
So it gets easy for us to search every information we're interested in on the web.
